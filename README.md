# Kaggle_Competitions
A compilation of code and data from dozens of Kaggle competitions I participated in.

New and old code notebooks made for Kaggle competitions. My GitHub can get rather cluttered making a new repository to feature for each one and some smaller or older code samples need a good home without obscuring newer and larger projects. As of this writing, I have participated in close to 40 Kaggle competitions and have an overall Competitions Expert rank of 512 of 96,038. 

(My red-headed stepchild Indeed Machine Learning Competition is also in here, despite being hosted on HackerRank)

# Google_Analytics_Data_Analysis
Data visualization and analysis of Google Analytic data from the Gstore (EDA)

This is exploritory data analysis for the Google Analytics Customer Revenue Prediction Competion on Kaggle. The competition ended on November 30th 2018 and the results are evaluated on future data compiled between December 1st 2018 to January 31st 2019.

Competition Objective
"In this competition, youâ€™re challenged to analyze a Google Merchandise Store (also known as GStore, where Google swag is sold) customer dataset to predict revenue per customer. Hopefully, the outcome will be more actionable operational changes and a better use of marketing budgets for those companies who choose to use data analysis on top of GA data."

# Humpback_Whale_Identification_Challenge
Image Classification of whale tails to determine identify the whale it came from

The difficulty in this image classification challenge comes from having thousands of different whales to classify between, often with one image example of each. This is mitigated somewhat with the allowance of 5 predictions per test image. Another part of the challenge is dealing with whales that have not been seen yet, which unlike the other categories, has ~800 samples. This makes for an extreme local minimum that is very tricky to get out of. Recognising this is the first step to a decent predictive model.

I got to this challenge late and only had 2 days to work on and train it. Still made substantial improvements passed the baseline in that time and improved the model after the competition deadline.
